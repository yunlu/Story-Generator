# Story-Generator

<b>Blurb</b>

Lady Lovelace once asserted that computers will never have the same creative capacity as humans.

In the years following her statement, extensive research in the field of Artificial Intelligence have been conducted in an attempt to imitate, or even surpass human mental capabilities.

But are machines capable of imagination? According to the book Artificial Intelligence and Literary Creativity, the key to creativity hangs on delicate balance between logic and wide variability. We attempt to explore creativity through the task of storytelling. Given a set of characters, a list of locations, and other parameters, our program will generate a short tale that is both logical and interesting. Through the use of scripts, goal planning algorithms, and pseudo-randomly generated events, our artificial author will be able to create a story consisting of a complex, and sometimes unpredictable chain of events.
